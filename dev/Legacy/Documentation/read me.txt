STEPS FOR COMPILING PROJECT HELP WITH SANDCASTLE

1. Install SandCastle and SandCastleBuilder (\\sahls04\Software$\Applications\DevTools\SandCastle)

2. You may need to install HTML Help

3. Run SandCastle builder, and add selected assemblies

4. Assemblies exhibiting "unknown xml" will need to be recompiled.  Open the project in Visual 
   Studio and open the project properties.  Click the "Build" tab, and enable the 
   "XML Documentation file" option and specify the creation of the XML file in the bin/Debug folder 
   (if not automatically done).

5. You will need to add the System assemblies to the dependencies.  Click the Dependencies option, 
   and add a folder dependency to "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727" (or whatever 
   version you are working with!).  

6. Add dependencies for any other assemblies that need to be included when compiling - the option 
   to select assemblies from the GAC does work.
